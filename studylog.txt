Week 2 - JS Novice to Ninja Ch. 2

Blocks - QUESTION Any purpose or function besides defining or grouping variables/constants within a specific section?

Number - I've always found it interesting that numbers aren't separated into integers and floating point

Var - Another text I was reading said it was fine to use appropriately

variable names - Remember that $ is used by JQuery. CASE SENSITIVE
    QUESTION - Is there any effect with PHP using variables like this? I wouldn't think so, but...

Escape characters - \' \" \n \r \t(tab)

Wrapper Objects - Interesting to know. Primitives don't have properties and methods, so Wrapper

Data type methods - can access with variable['method'] or .method

String literals - `` with `Hello ${ variable }`;

Exponents - 1e6 1 million   2E3 is 2 * 10^3  operator is ** for exponentiation

Compound Assignment Operator - points +=10 = (points = points + 10)
    - ++ operator for incrementing
        - let points = 5; points++ will return 5 then increase to 6
            ++points will return 6 then return it

TYPE COERCION!!!
    - adding strings and numbers will try and convert to strings
        - '8' + 2 = '82'

False values:
            * "" // double quoted empty string literal
            * '' // single quoted empty string literal
            * `` // empty template literal
            * 0
            * -0 // considered different to 0 by JavaScript!
            * NaN
            * false
            * null
            * undefined

Negative Logical Operator - ! eg !true == false

Logical and - &&
Logical or - ||

Equality Operators - Remember == is soft and === is hard (same value and type)
